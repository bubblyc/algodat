  \section{Results}

  \todo[inline]{Briefly comment the results, did the script say all your solutions were correct? Approximately how long time does it take for the program to run on the largest input? What takes the majority of the time?}

    All solutions correct.
    Parsing took approx 100ms and the algorithm took approx 4,5 seconds on 4huge.in
    Majority of the execution time was the algorithm.

  \section{Implementation details}

  \todo[inline]{How did you implement the solution? Which data structures were used? Which modifications to these data structures were used? What is the overall running time? Why?}

    To store the lookup table for the alignment costs a HashMap in a HashMap was used in order for quick lookups.
    To set up the costMatrix a 2D array was used.
